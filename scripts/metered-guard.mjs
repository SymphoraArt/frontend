/**
 * Hard cap on calls to metered providers, for throwaway probes and benchmarks.
 *
 * Import this FIRST in any script that might reach a paid API:
 *
 *   import "./scripts/metered-guard.mjs";
 *   // then run with:  METERED_BUDGET=3 node __bench-whatever.mjs
 *
 * It patches globalThis.fetch, so it also covers SDKs that call out on their
 * own (@google/genai and the OpenAI client both use fetch underneath) — the
 * script does not get to decide what counts.
 *
 * ── Why it counts EVERY request, including ones expected to fail ──────────
 * On 2026-08-06 a probe sent deliberately invalid values to WaveSpeed on the
 * assumption that an invalid request is rejected before anything is billed.
 * That held for an invalid *value* and not for an unknown *field*: WaveSpeed
 * ignored the unknown field, accepted the request, and started a real
 * generation. The assumption was the defect.
 *
 * So there is no "free probe" category here. A request to a metered host
 * counts the moment it is made, because whether it bills is the provider's
 * decision and not something this side can know in advance.
