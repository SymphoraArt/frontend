/**
 * Quality — low | mid | high, for models that take it as their own parameter.
 *
 * Only the gpt-image family does, on both hosts. It is a real setting there,
 * and the dominant one for price: roughly $0.006 / $0.053 / $0.211 per image at
 * 1024x1024, a 35x spread — far more than the size changes. So it belongs in
 * front of the user rather than being derived from the resolution tier, which
 * is what the server did before and was a guess about intent.
 *
 * Hidden entirely for models without it. Gemini has no such concept, and a
 * control that changes nothing is exactly the kind of thing this codebase has
 * been busy removing.
