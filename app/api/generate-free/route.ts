/**
 * Free image generation endpoint (dev/testing)
 *
 * Uses Pollinations.ai (free, no API key needed)
 * No payment required, no database needed.
 *
 * REQUIRES A SESSION as of 2026-08-18. It used to be deliberately
 * unauthenticated, which made the per-account free allowance decorative: the
 * way around three-per-account was to log out, because an anonymous caller has
 * no user_id for an allowance to count against and an IP is neither stable nor
 * personal. Free generation is now: team roles without a limit, every other
 * account three images, nobody else.
 *
 * The other guards stay exactly as they were — the same moderation the paid
 * path gets, a per-IP rate limit, and violations attributed by hashed IP.
 *
 * POST /api/generate-free
 * Body: { prompt, aspectRatio?, resolution?, workflow? }
 * Reference images are refused here — the free model is text-only.
