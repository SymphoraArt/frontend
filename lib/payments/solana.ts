/**
 * The Solana side of generation payments: which chain, which connection, and
 * the one keypair that signs everything Enki signs.
 *
 * Chain resolution matches lib/usdc-balance.ts exactly, so a balance is always
 * read from the chain a payment settles on. Nothing here is a request
 * parameter — a client that could pick the chain could pick devnet and pay in
 * play money.
 *
 * ── The fee payer ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Enki pays every fee (Terms of Use, Section 4). That is not generosity: our
 * buyers onboard through Coinbase Onramp and hold USDC, not SOL, so a fee
 * pushed onto them does not get collected — it surfaces as a generation that
 * fails for a reason they cannot act on. At ~0.13 cents per generation the
 * alternative costs more in lost checkouts than it saves.
 *
 * The same keypair is the NONCE AUTHORITY, and that part is structural rather
 * than economic: voiding an authorisation whose buyer has closed the tab is
 * only possible if we can act on the nonce alone. Hand that authority to the
 * buyer and abandoned authorisations could never be flushed.
