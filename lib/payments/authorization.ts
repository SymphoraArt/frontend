/**
 * The life of one generation authorisation.
 *
 * Kev, 2026-08-06: "once the image goes through, we will receive the money.
 * otherwise it will be sent back." Taken literally that rules out a refund
 * worker, because a refund presupposes a charge that should not have happened.
 * So nothing is charged until the image exists.
 *
 * The buyer signs a Solana transfer built on a durable nonce and we hold it
 * unbroadcast. That signature is an authorisation, not a payment, and it ends
 * exactly one of two ways:
 *
 *   capture  we broadcast it        the image was delivered
 *   void     we advance the nonce   nothing was, or ever will be, charged
 *
 * Both are claimed with a conditional UPDATE that demands the other be unset,
 * so a race has a loser rather than two winners. Broadcasting AND flushing the
 * same nonce is the one outcome this file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * ── The abort condition ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The authorisation dies at the first terminal state that is not delivery,
 * and otherwise at a DEADLINE measured from the moment work started.
 *
 * This used to be a heartbeat: the running job renewed its claim every 15s and
 * three missed beats meant abandoned. The argument for it was that a deadline
 * would kill slow-but-legitimate generations. On this platform that argument
 * does not hold — the generate route's own budget ladder makes the upper bound
 * a fact rather than a guess:
 *
 *     285s  the route's in-process timeout
 *     300s  maxDuration — Vercel kills the function here
 *     330s  SLOT_TTL_MS
 *     360s  everything above has expired; the worker is provably gone
 *
 * A generation CANNOT run past 300s, so nothing legitimate is ever cut short
 * by waiting 360. The heartbeat was solving a problem the platform already
 * solves, and it cost more than it bought: it needed a beat, a timer, a
 * lost() signal nobody branched on, and it made the sweep's SELECT and its
 * write disagree about a moving value — a race that voided live authorisations
 * and shipped their images free.
 *
 * consumed_at is the anchor instead, set once by claimForGeneration when the
 * work actually starts. It never moves, so selection and execution cannot
 * disagree. Same rule generation-redemption.ts already used to decide a claim
 * is provably dead.
 *
 * IF ENKI EVER LEAVES VERCEL this reasoning goes with it (Kev, 2026-08-19).
 * Without a platform-enforced maxDuration there is no upper bound to derive a
 * deadline from, and the heartbeat has to come back — it is in the history of
 * this file, not lost.
