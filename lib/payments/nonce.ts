/**
 * The life of one durable nonce account.
 *
 * Kev, 2026-08-06: no pool. One account per intent, created with it and closed
 * at whatever ends it. That is not the more expensive option, it is the
 * cheaper one — closing returns the rent, and it removes the shared resource a
 * pool would need leasing logic for.
 *
 * ── Closing IS the flush ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The runtime checks that a nonce account is in the `Initialized` state before
 * honouring a durable-nonce transaction. Withdrawing the full balance deletes
 * the account, so that check fails forever afterwards: the buyer's signed
 * transaction is permanently dead AND the 1,447,680 lamports come back, in one
 * instruction. Advancing the nonce would also kill the signature but leaves
 * the account, and its rent, sitting there.
 *
 * The one wrinkle, from the Anza spec: an account cannot be closed while its
 * stored nonce is still the cluster's most recent blockhash. That is a
 * one-slot condition (~400ms), not a real wait, but a close attempted straight
 * after creation will hit it — so it is retried rather than treated as
 * failure.
