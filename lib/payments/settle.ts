/**
 * Where the decision in the database meets the chain.
 *
 * lib/payments/authorization.ts decides WHETHER we may charge — a single
 * conditional UPDATE picks one winner between capture and void. This file
 * carries that decision out. The split matters: the claim is atomic and the
 * chain is not, so everything that can fail slowly happens after the winner is
 * already settled.
 *
 * ── Which way a crash should fail ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Capture claims first, broadcasts second. If we die in between, we hold a
 * captured intent with no signature on chain — recoverable, because a
 * durable-nonce transaction does not expire and nobody else can advance that
 * nonce. Void writes the row first, closes the account second: a closed
 * account with an open row would be swept forever, whereas a voided row with a
 * live nonce is caught by the next sweep. Both orders leak something; these
 * are the orders that leak a retry rather than a charge.
