/**
 * What "4K" means, in one place.
 *
 * Before this file each adapter invented its own answer and they disagreed by
 * more than an order of magnitude for the same request: Pollinations mapped 4K
 * to a 1024 base edge and then clamped it to ~0.59 MP, WaveSpeed forwarded the
 * opaque string "4k", Gemini attached an imageSize only for one hardcoded model
 * id, and OpenAI converted the tier to a pixel target of its own. A buyer who
 * picked 4K therefore got anything between 0.59 MP and 17 MP depending on which
 * host the router happened to choose, and nothing anywhere compared the two.
 *
 * The ceilings below are the providers' own documented limits, read 2026-08-13:
 *
 *  - gemini / gemini-3-pro-image — imageSize accepts "1K" | "2K" | "4K"
 *    (uppercase K is mandatory, "lowercase parameters will be rejected"). 4K is
 *    not square: 4096x4096 at 1:1, 5504x3072 at 16:9, 6336x2688 at 21:9.
 *  - gemini / gemini-2.5-flash-image — has no imageSize at all and always
 *    returns ~1 MP. Measured 2026-08-06, and the docs agree.
 *  - wavespeed / nano-banana-pro and gpt-image-2 — `resolution` enum
 *    "1k" | "2k" | "4k", default 1k. 8k exists only on the -ultra endpoints,
 *    which nothing here routes to.
 *  - openai / gpt-image-2 — `size` takes arbitrary "WIDTHxHEIGHT" with a max
 *    edge of 3840 and a max total of 8,294,400 px, so 3840x2160 is the top.
 *  - pollinations / flux — the docs state no maximum at all; the real ceiling
 *    lives in the GPU worker as a total-pixel budget (MAX_PIXELS, 589,824).
 *    Nothing it returns can exceed 0.59 MP, so "4K" there is at most a
 *    fourteenth of a 4K frame. Running the adapter's own arithmetic against
 *    today's 512/768/1024 ladder: at 1:1 and 16:9 the 2K and 4K requests
 *    collapse onto the SAME image (768x768, 1024x576) because both overshoot
 *    the budget; at 4:5 they still differ, 614x768 against 687x859. The live
 *    rows show them fully identical at 4:5 too (686x858 for both), but those
 *    were recorded before the base ladder was restored, so treat them as
 *    history rather than as the current mapping. Either way the honest
 *    ceiling is 2K and offering 4K is a promise nothing can keep.
