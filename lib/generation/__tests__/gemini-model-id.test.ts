/*
 * Google shut down gemini-3-pro-image-preview on 2026-06-25 ("The
 * gemini-3-pro-image-preview models are deprecated and will be shut down on
 * June 25, 2026"). The GA id, released 2026-05-28, is gemini-3-pro-image. Our
 * live rows and our code both still carried the dead one on 2026-08-12, seven
 * weeks after the shutdown.
 *
 * Renaming it is the easy half. The dangerous half is that TWO behaviours
 * branched on the exact string, and both fail SILENTLY when it stops matching:
 *
 *   - imageSize is only attached for this family, so a miss means the buyer
 *     pays for 4K and receives 1024² with nothing reporting the difference;
 *   - the cost estimate only has a rate for this family, so a miss books a
 *     paid generation at $0.
 *
 * Neither raises an error. Both are exactly the failure this codebase keeps
 * producing, so both get a test rather than a careful rename.
