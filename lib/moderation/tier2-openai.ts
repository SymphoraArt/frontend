/**
 * Tier 2 — the AI classifier. This is the layer that actually decides.
 *
 * Why a classifier and not a chat model: `omni-moderation-latest` scores text
 * against fixed categories. It has no instructions to override, so "ignore all
 * previous instructions" does nothing to it. A GPT-as-judge would be a live
 * prompt-injection target; this is not.
 *
 * It is also multilingual, which the word list is not — Tier 1 only understands
 * English, and the product is global.
 *
 * Free endpoint, so there is no per-request cost to weigh.
 *
 * NOT YET ACTIVE: the project has no OpenAI account as of 2026-08-04. Until a
 * key exists this module reports "degraded" and the pipeline falls through to
 * allow — which is exactly why Tier 1 keeps blocking the unambiguous cases on
 * its own in the meantime.
