/**
 * A missed model lookup does not throw here — it silently downgrades the whole
 * generation.
 *
 * generateWithModel derives `const isFree = !model || model.price <= 0`, so a
 * null model routes to /api/generate-free (Flux) and drops modelIds, boost AND
 * quality with it. The user picks GPT-Image-2, sees its price, and receives a
 * free Flux image. Drafts carry the model as a slug while the catalogue keys by
 * UUID, so an exact-id find at the call site produced exactly that.
