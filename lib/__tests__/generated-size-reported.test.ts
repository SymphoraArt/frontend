/**
 * A route that generates an image must report the size it actually produced.
 *
 * The free worker clamps on TOTAL pixels before diffusing, so what a reader
 * asks for and what they receive routinely differ — a 2K request comes back
 * 686x858 at 4:5. For months the only place that disagreement was visible was
 * a database column nobody reads: the adapter measured the bytes, the route
 * computed the measurement for the media type, and then dropped it from the
 * response. The buyer surface therefore had nothing to show but the request.
