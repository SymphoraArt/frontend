 * WaveSpeed image generation.

 * WaveSpeed hosts the same models Google does — Nano Banana Pro among them —
 * at a lower price and a markedly higher latency. That trade is the product:
 * WaveSpeed is the normal path, and "boost" spends more to go direct.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-06, same prompt, nano-banana-pro:
 *   WaveSpeed 1K  73.1s   2K  78.1s   4K  77.0s
 *   Gemini    1K  19.2s   2K  28.5s   4K  38.8s
 *
 * ── Why this is not PR #54's version ────────────────────────────────────
 * That one POSTs to /api/v3/predictions with {model_id, input}. The live API
 * rejects it ("page is required; page_size is required") — /predictions is a
 * listing endpoint. The model belongs in the PATH. Verified against the real
 * API before writing this. Its metadata also reported the model as
 * "wavespeed-nano-banana-pro" while actually running flux-dev.
