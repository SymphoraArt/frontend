/**
 * THE one source for generation-core settings (Kev, 2026-08-22: "every
 * generation UI derives the generation core settings the same way with the
 * einstellungen being set up only globally").
 *
 * Layering:
 *   models table (DB)  →  /api/models (withCapabilities: maxResolution,
 *   allowed_ratios, supportsQuality, tierScale, boostAvailable — resolved by
 *   the SAME code the generation enforces)  →  useModelCatalogue  →  THIS
 *   hook  →  every generate surface.
 *
 * A surface may render its own controls, but every OPTION LIST, PRICE and
 * VISIBILITY decision comes from here. Nothing model-specific may be
 * hardcoded in a component — that is how three surfaces once carried three
 * different ratio lists and a 2K/4K list survived after the models stopped
 * matching it.
 *
 * Per-surface variance is expressed through the arguments, not through
 * copies: `freeRoute: true` says "this surface renders on the free route
 * regardless of the selected model" (quick create today, the buyer
 * generator's no-charge path), which clamps tiers and ratios to the free
 * model's ceiling instead of the selection's.
