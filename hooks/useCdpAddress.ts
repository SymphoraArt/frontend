/**
 * The user's CDP embedded-wallet Solana address — drop-in replacement for the
 * `address` that useTurnkeyEmailAuth used to provide.
 *
 * Reads lib/cdp-bridge (a module store fed by CdpWalletBridge) rather than the
 * @coinbase/cdp-hooks directly, and that is deliberate: the CDP provider is
 * mounted lazily and only for signed-in users, so calling a CDP hook from the
 * ~20 components that need an address would throw wherever the provider is not
 * mounted. The bridge is plain module state plus a window event, so it is safe
 * to call anywhere, at any time, signed in or not.
