/**
 * CDP embedded-wallet signer for Solana — the replacement for
 * useTurnkeySolanaSigner.
 *
 * Why this exists: Turnkey signs the BUYER's transaction *server-side*
 * (/api/turnkey/sign-transaction, and the intent path in
 * /api/payments/generation/pay). That is custodial — a key our server controls
 * can move a user's funds. Here the server never sees a buyer signature: the
 * transaction goes from the browser to the user's own wallet and back.
 *
 * Deliberately the SAME shape as TurnkeySolanaSigner so the swap in
 * useSolanaX402Payment is a one-line change in the priority chain rather than a
 * rewrite of the payment flow.
 *
 * ── On "permissionless" ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is NOT permissionless. Signing is an API call to Coinbase: the key lives
 * in their TEE, and they can suspend the project or a user. It is a large
 * improvement over server-side signing (Enki can no longer sign alone), but the
 * censorship-resistant version is local signing with a client-held key — see
 * the self-custody work. This module is written so that a `local` signer can
 * slot in beside it under the same interface, which is also how additional
 * networks will be added later.
 *
 * ── Why this goes through lib/cdp-bridge ──────────────────────────────────
 * It must NOT call @coinbase/cdp-hooks directly. The CDP provider is mounted
 * lazily and only for signed-in users, while this hook is reached from the
 * editor, which renders whether or not that provider exists — calling a CDP
 * hook there throws "useCDP must be used within a CDPHooksProvider" and takes
 * the whole editor down. The bridge is plain module state plus window events,
 * so it is safe to call anywhere; the actual signing happens in
 * CdpWalletBridge, which does live inside the provider.
